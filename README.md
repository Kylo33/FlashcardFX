#### Building from Source:

First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Kylo33/FlashcardFX.git
cd FlashcardFX
```

Then, use **Maven** to build the app:

```
mvn package
```

To use the app, head to the `target` directory, and run the `jar` file (`java -jar flashcard-fx-{version}.jar` or `chmod +x flashcard-fx-{version}.jar` and open it using your file manager).

#### Reflection

By far the most difficult part about building this project was creating the **Deck Editor** page. It was incredibly difficult to manage the 'dirty' states of so many modules and components, and the library I used ([DirtyFX](https://github.com/thomasnield/DirtyFX)) is unmaintained (I found some problems myself, but the maintainer is inactive & I don't want to support the library myself, as it is written in Kotlin). So, I ended up making some helper classes of my own (`DeepDirtyList` and `DeepDirtyProperty`) which helped tremendously.

In addition, I restarted this project several times in an attempt to clean up my code. It still isn't perfect, but I am proud of the state it is in. If you look back at some of the older commits on this branch, I pretty much deleted everything after completing the project once. With my real-life time commitments, this was a difficult decision, and I really started to run out of motivation at some points. I am glad that I persevered, but I am unsure if the time I spent rebuilding the project was worth it.

This project taught me a lot about object-oriented programming and designing GUI apps that I am extremely glad to have pursued. I chose to use JavaFX after a brief introduction in the Univeristy of Helsinki's Java Programming courses, but building a multi-screen app was much more challenging. I ended up using the MVCI-architecture proposed by Dave Barrett on [PragmaticCoding](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/javafx/mvci/) it works really well and he gives countless examples that served as a lot of guidance throughout the entire project.
